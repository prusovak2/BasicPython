I know these         will all be        stories some day,
and         our pictures will       become old photographs.

 We all become somebody’s mom or dad.
        But right now, these moments are not stories.
         This is happening.

 I am here, and I am looking at her.
  And she is so beautiful.
  I can see         it.

   This one     moment when you     know you’re not     a sad story.
    You are alive.

     And you stand up and see the lights on the buildings and everything that makes you wonder.


      And you’re listening to that       song, and that drive with the people who you love most in this world.

       And in         this moment,       I swear, we are infinite.
